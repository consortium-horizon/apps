Running phpList from the commandline

Commandline processing requires PHP 4.3.0 or higher

A few pages in the PHPlist system can now, as of version 2.7.0 be run with 
a simple command from the commandline.

the script to use is called "phplist" in the "bin" directory. You will have to edit 
this script to fit your system

The normal PHPlist access restrictions are bypassed, but the Unix users who are
allowed to run the script should be mentioned in the "commandline_users" config
variable. The identity of a user is determined by the USER environment variable, which
may not always match your system.

The "p" parameter is the page that needs to be run. 
Currently you can use "send", "processqueue" and "processbounces"

phplist -psend

This will require some more arguments:

-l list
-s subject
[-f from]

and you need to "pipe" the message into the script.

The -l parameter can have two types of values, the name of the list or the number of the list. 
You can added multiple lists or multiple -l parameters
The subject can have spaces
The from is optional. It will default to the system administrator as set up in your config.

So the full "send" command line would be:

phplist -psend -s This is the subject -l test 1 2 3 -f me@server.com < messagefile
