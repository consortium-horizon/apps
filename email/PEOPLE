Contributors to PHPlist.

Most of the code of PHPlist was hand written by Michiel Dethmers, using
kate (http://kate.kde.org/) on a Redhat 7.3 (http://www.redhat.com) system.

For sending HTML emails, PHPlist uses the class from Richard Heyes
<richard@phpguru.org>, although gradually this class is being modified to
fit more closely into the PHPlist methods.

For parsing RSS feeds, the Onyx-RSS class from Ed Swindelles <ed@readinged.com> was
used. Currently this class has been used verbatim. Lots of thanks go to Ed.
More info in the lists/admin/onyxrss directory

For a more visual message editing facility the FCKeditor from Frederico Caldeira Knabben
has been integrated. Frederico has done a brilliant job, and we're very thankful
for making his code LGPL.
More information is at http://www.fredck.com/FCKeditor/

Thanks go to all the people who have contributed (and are contributing) by
donating, submitting bugreports or feature requests, and by commissioning changes
that they really want and are willing to pay for. These are quite a few, and it's
a growing group of people, so it's becoming more and more difficult to keep
track of who did what and how. Below is a list of some people I managed to
identify, but if you are not listed, your contribution is still very appreciated.
If you feel you want to be listed here, (or if you want to get out of this list),
let me know.

Ben Henshall made the current design. I think it looks great :-)
