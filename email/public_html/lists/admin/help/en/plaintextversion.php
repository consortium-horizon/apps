<h3>Plain text version</h3>

<p>Every email, even when the content is HTML, needs to have a plain text version. This is enforced by the internet standards and phpList cannot change that.
If you leave this empty, phpList will automatically generate text content from your HTML. Alternatively, you can enter the text content of your campaign here yourself.</p>

<h3>Who gets to see the text version? </h3>

<p>The text version will be displayed to two types of subscribers</p>

<ol>
<li>Subscribers who have their preferences in phpList set to receive text emails. <br/>
<i>These subscribers will be sent the text version only.</i></li>
<li>Subscribers who have email readers that cannot display the HTML version. <br/>
Some subscribers use programs to read their email that do not handle HTML. In that case, they will see the text version only. This is decided on the subscriber end of the communication channel.
<i>These subscribers will receive the normal email containing both HTML and text, but their system decides to show them the text version.</i>
</li>
</ol>
