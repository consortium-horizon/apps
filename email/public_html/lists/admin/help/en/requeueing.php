<h3>Re-queue Campaign</h3>

<p>When you choose to re-queue a campaign, the campaign will be placed back in the queue, when sending has finished.
The embargo of the campaign will be set to the time plus the requeue-frequency you specify here.
</p>

<p>This will cause the campaign to be sent to subscribers who have signed up, after sending the campaign.</p>
