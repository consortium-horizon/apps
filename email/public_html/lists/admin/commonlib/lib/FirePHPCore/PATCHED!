Around line 661 the following was changed:

- $meta['file'] = isset($trace[$i]['file'])?$this->_escapeTraceFile($trace[$i+]['file']):'';
- $meta['line'] = isset($trace[$i]['line'])?$trace[$i]['line']:'';

+ $meta['file'] = isset($trace[$i+$this->options['LineNumbersSkipNested']]['file'])?$this->_escapeTraceFile($trace[$i+$this->options['LineNumbersSkipNested']]['file']):'';
+ $meta['line'] = isset($trace[$i+$this->options['LineNumbersSkipNested']]['line'])?$trace[$i+$this->options['LineNumbersSkipNested']]['line']:'';

options 'LineNumbersSkipNested' should be set to '1' to show who was calling the function that was calling firePHP
