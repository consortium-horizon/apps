Help & Support
==============

<br />

Below are the places where you may expect to get help and support for the Hybridauth project.

1. **Community Support:** For general questions (i.e, "how-to" questions), consider using StackOverflow Q&A Website.
For convenience, we also have a Gitter channel. And keep in mind these are community driven, low activity forums and
therefore your questions may not be answered on timely fashion.

2. **Github issues tracker:** This method is limited to reporting bugs, features requests and for collaboration. Please
avoid posting one-line issues on Github: When reporting new issue, provide as much detail and context as possible,
otherwise we will be left in the dark about the problem you having. Thanks for understanding.
