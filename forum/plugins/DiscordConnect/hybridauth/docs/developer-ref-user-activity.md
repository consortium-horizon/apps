User's Activity Stream
======================

Similarly to the user's profile, after authentication, Hybridauth can provide the connected user activity
stream in a simple and **standardized structure** across the social APIs supporting this feature.

If a provider does not support this feature, Hybridauth will throw an exception `NotImplementedException`.
To know more about providers capabilities, refer to [Supported Providers](providers.html) .

**Usage :**

<pre>
//Instantiate Twitter Adapter
$twitter = new Hybridauth\Provider\Twitter($config);

//Sign in with twitter
$twitter->authenticate();

//Retrieve User's latest tweets
$timeline = $adapter->getUserActivity('me'); //Returns an array of Hybridauth\User\Activity objects

//Iterate over the user's timeline
foreach($timeline as $item){
    echo $item->user->displayName . ': ' . $item->text . "\n";
}
</pre>
