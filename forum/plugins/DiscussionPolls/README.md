FAQ
===
Where do I actually add my poll?
--------------------------------
Polls are attached in add/edit discussion screen. Check the Attach Poll box and
start inserting your poll questions!

What do the permissions actually mean?
--------------------------------------
The View permission allows users to actually view polls. The Vote permission
allows a user to vote in any poll. The Add permission allows users to add and
remove polls attached to their own discussions. The manage permission allows a
user to add and remove polls attached to _any_ discussion

Why can't I attach a poll to my existing discussion?
----------------------------------------------------
If you have the Add permission and you are still unable to attach a poll, your
forum most likely has an edit time limit. **You mush be able to edit the
discussion you are attaching the poll to**.
