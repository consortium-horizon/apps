# minusbaseline
Mobile Vanilla Theme

This mobile theme sticks to the default (+Baseline) look and feel of Vanilla and is intended to be used as a base for mobile themes.
Most customizations made to the default theme should work with this theme, too.

* Most of the sprites have been replaced with an icon-font.
* The panel becomes a sliding menu.
* The pagination and various buttons are more touch-friendly.
* Flyout menus trigger a native select menu, which is less painful to use on a mobile device.

To display the panel on the left side, add this to your config.php:

``$Configuration['MinusBaseline']['Panel']['Left'] = true;``
